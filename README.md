## 10bis Exercise

A company decided to give all its employees a 10bis card, to be used for buying lunch.  
The daily budget set by the company is 400 NIS.   
If the employee used an amount higher than that, he should pay the delta.  

### Reporting App

Attached is a skeleton of a React-based application.
The file ```src/data/raw.data.js``` exposes a CSV string that describes the monthly 10bis expenses of a specific employee.    

You should extend the application, by adding the following features:
1. A table/grid that shows a readable report of the CSV.
2. At the bottom of the table, add a summary that will outline the payment distribution between the company and the employee.
